/** STRATEGIES AND TECHNIQUES TO USE WHEN DEALING WITH ARRAY-RELATED PROBLEMS:
    1. Brute force ->  iterating through the array and checking each element against a certain condition
    2. Two-Pointer Technique -> used When dealing with sorted arrays or looking for pairs of elements that meet a specific criteria 
    3. Sliding Window -> useful when dealing with subarray or substring problems
    4. Prefix Sum ->  compute sums or other aggregations over subarrays eg subarray sums in constant time.
    5. Binary Search -> find a specific element or determine if a certain element exists in the array over sorted arrau
    6. Hashing -> useful for solving problems involving frequency counting, finding duplicates, or tracking elements and their associated data
    7. Sorting -> simplify the problem-solving process or make it easier to identify patterns.
    8. Dynamic Programming -> used to optimize the solution by breaking it down into smaller subproblems
    9. Greedy Algorithms -> applied to array problems when making decisions based on specific criteria
    10. Counting and Bucketing -> se counting techniques or divide the array into buckets to solve problems efficiently.
    11. Recursion -> when the problem can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem
    12. Prefix Trees (Trie) ->  efficient pattern matching and retrieval in strings or sequences
    13. Bit Manipulation -> For problems involving individual bits or binary representations
    14. Graph Algorithms -> solve problems related to connectivity, shortest paths, and more
    15. Divide and Conquer -> For problems that can be divided into smaller independent subproblems
