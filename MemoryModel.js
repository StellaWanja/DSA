/* In order to work with computers, we need to convert everything(including data) into 0s and 1s(binary form)
   - Numbers can be converted to their binary form by converting them to base 2
   - Non-numeric data can first be encoded into numbers and then into binary form

   Memory model -> abstraction over the real working of the computer memory that makes it easy for us to understand how our code interacts with the memory
   -ie, how our data is stored, retrieved and updated
   - Memory is just a large number of boxes that can hold data(bytes)
   - 1 byte -> 8 bits
   - 1 bit -> a binary digit that can either be 0 or 1
   - address -> unique identifier of a byte
   - The address of data in memory is the first byte from where the data starts
