//works by counting the number of objects having distinct key values (a kind of hashing).
//Then do some arithmetic operations to calculate the position of each object in the output sequence. 
//consider the data in range of 0-9 (key value = 9)
// arr=[1,4,1,2,7,5,2]
//Take a count array to store the count of each unique object and place count at appropriate index
//index: 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
//count: 0  2  2  0  1  1  0  1  0  0
