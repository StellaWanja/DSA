//Comparison based algos
// 1. Bubble sort
// 2. Selection sort
// 3. Insertion sort
// 4. Heap sort
// 5. Merge sort
// 6. Quick sort

//Non-comparison based algos
// 1. Radix sort
// 2. Counting sort

//stability of an algo -> how the algorithm treats comparable items with equal sort keys
//A stable sorting algorithm maintains the relative order of the items with equal sort keys
//eg Grades -> Earl- B, Fabian- B, Gill-B
// after sorting with stable algo, is still the same (sorted alphabetically)
// unstable sort -> Gill-B, Fabian-B, Earl-B (not sorted alphabetically)

//Stable algos -> insertion, bubble, merge
//Unstable algos -> selection, shell
