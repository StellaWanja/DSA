// ALGORITHMIC THINKING STEPS:
// 1. Understand the problem - its input and output
// 2. Formulate the problem  in terms of input & output
//    - use our mathematical skills, and use knowledge of representations to represent the data
// 3. Now that we understand how the problem is formulated and structured mathematically, 
// develop an algorithm for solving this problem in the sense that the algorithm will 
//take input and will give us output
// 4. Implement the algorithm developed in step 3
// 5. Running the algorithm on the data and answer the original question

//WRITING PSEUDOCODE:
// for instance, getting the smallest element in arr A
// pseudocode 1 : x = smallest element in arr A
// pseudocode 2:
            //  x = Infinity;
            // for i=0 to A-1
            //   if A[i] < x
            //   x = A[i]
// pseudocode 3:
            // sort list A in increasing order
            // return A[0]
