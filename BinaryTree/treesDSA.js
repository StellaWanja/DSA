/** COMMON TREE TERMS
    1. Neighbor - Parent or child of a node
    2. Ancestor - predecessor node on the path from root to that node
    3. Descendant  - successor node on the path from that node to leaf node
    4. Degree - Number of children of a node
    5. Degree of a tree - Maximum degree of nodes in the tree
    6. Distance - Number of edges along the shortest path between two nodes
    7. Level/Depth - Number of edges along the unique path between a node and the root node
    8. Width - Number of nodes in a level
    9. Height of a node - no. of edges in the longest path from that node to a leaf
 */

/** BINARY TREE TERMS
    1. Complete binary tree - A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, 
                            except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the 
                            last level are as far left as possible.
    2. Balanced binary tree - A binary tree structure in which the left and right subtrees of every
                            node differ in height by no more than 1.

/** INTERVIEW TIPS
    -> When a question involves a BST, the
        interviewer is usually looking for a solution which runs faster than O(n)
    -> be very familiar with writing pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal recursively and iteratively
